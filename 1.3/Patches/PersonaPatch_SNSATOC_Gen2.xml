                            <description>A weapon made of pure Cosmic Alloy, further supercharged with pure Cosmic Matter, the Handheld Cosmic Lance is a miniature version of the Cosmic Lance, a supermassive ship weapon. It charges slowly and takes a long time to cool down between shots, but is able to utterly devastate whatever its projectiles hit. Few things are able to withstand more than a single shot from the Lance.\n\nWhile it excels at long range and extremely close range, it is highly inconsistent at medium ranges. Care should be taken with the Lance since its explosions can accidentially destroy things.\n\nThe full-sized ship weapon Cosmic Lance is both extremely rare and feared for its ability to devastate entire planets with just a few Cosmic Lances firing down from orbit, despite it needing a long time to cool down between shots.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>
