                            <description>The 357-Secant . It's compact design capable of discharging heavy suppression fire, quickly became a favorite for private militaries. Manufactured by Kruz Industries, the weapon was a no nonsense utilitarian design. 
                        
                        The weapon featured a detachable buttstock allowing for use in cramped conditions. Something that those fighting in claustrophobic maintenance tunnels were quick to appreciate about the weapon. Not only this but the explosive reverberations of the Secant’s magnum hail-fire in those tight corridors became the stuff of nightmares for those unlucky enough to face them. 
                        
                        The weapon eventually became synonymous with the hired union busters that plagued industrial worlds. The banana clips the weapon featured almost exclusively were well suited for their primary purpose - suppression. The steady stream of suppressive fire provided by alternating gunners dominated the field, giving no room for resistance. 
                        
                        This suppression fire gave the 357-Secant its name with the tracers ammunition most often used increasing its intimidation factor; it was said that 357 lines would cross the field of battle between the operator and its prey.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>New Southern Falch Army was looking for a weapon to solve the nation's dependence on foriegn providers. Debna and Lephleon would ultimately win that contract with their design of the The 7G Kilo. A heavy battle rifle in designation alone, Debna and Lephleon impressed the brass with just how light weight the weapon was in comparison to the amount of firepower it provided. 
                        
                        The 7G Kilo got its name from its extreme light weight; being joked to only weigh 7 grams but capable of taking a toll from its enemies in the form of a kilogram of flesh. 
                        
                        The weapon was light and well suited for urban combat situations. Made of polymers and stamped metal pieces in large part the weapon was not only light but cheap to manufacture. The only downsides were that the weapon needed regular maintenance, otherwise it was prone to malfunction. 
                        
                        These issues were of no consequence for the Falch Army since their engagements most often took the form of storming malcontent facilities in fast and deadly raids. Then after missions, in transit to their next location, the team would break down their weapons and administer the necessary maintenance- the vehicles they traveled in doubling as mobile facilities. 
                        
                        The common issues the weapon has are largely due to its weight-saving design. The amount of material removed and skeletonization of the firearm, with the mix of heavy, milled parts have left it somewhat open for dirt to get in. This was viewed as acceptable due to its application in urban environments. Additionally the primary malfunction the weapon incurs with a lack of maintenance is failure to cycle ammunation properly sometimes requiring a quick manual cycle to reset.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Originally a training rifle, the light weight of the AC7, while maintaining sufficient durability lead it being adopted as a compact charge assault carbine for drop pod assaults. It's lighter construction allows the weapon to be brought up and aimed very easily, though it does do less damage. Pulse-charge technology charges each shot with unstable energy as it leaves the barrel. Released on impact, the charged energy greatly increases the damage done.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Alpha Omega personal sidearm was designed in the heyday of Grand Republic freedom. A notion that would soon become eclipsed by the iron fist of Kyros occupation. Alpha Omega firearms are now a rarity sought by collectors.
                        
                        A simple but elegant design with night sights, it was meant to be the citizens sidearm. The first and only weapon to stop any would be a threat to the citizenry. Something which became obsolete quickly with the new police state. That said, Kyros found the wide distribution of these weapons to citizens an unexpected source of frustration. A gun with a far larger caliber than Kyros would expect any sane nation to allow its citizens to wield, the weapon weighed in at 4 kilograms loaded and allowed the Grand Republic to maintain a healthy resistance force for over half a decade. Police forces of Kyros to this day regret accepting Grand Republic stations.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The AM-0001 by Akker Rose Industries, is an anti material rifle designed with wealthy clientele in mind. Most often Yakuza agents sent to remove key assets from service or individuals dumb enough to believe they are safe in their ivory towers. 
                        
                        A five round magazine, the AM-0001 is meant to be fired with careful precision, especially considering the extreme expense paid per round. That being said, each round is capable of penetrating all but the most well armored tanks on capital worlds. This being the case due to their combination of conventional armor and dampening fields, although it is said that even these measures can be overcome with the right ammo. Ammo that has been made illegal on all core worlds. 
                        
                        The weapon is capable of firing from extreme range with a maximum effective range of two kilometers, leaving no chance for discovery before the operator has already evaced. However, just in case, the weapon has been outfitted with a bayonet capable of slicing through military grade armor for close quarter encounters. This final piece, while most considered unnecessary, is what ended up endearing the weapon within Yakuza circles.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The AM-0001 by Akker Rose Industries, is an anti material rifle designed with wealthy clientele in mind. Most often Yakuza agents sent to remove key assets from service or individuals dumb enough to believe they are safe in their ivory towers. 
                        
                        A five round magazine, the AM-0001 is meant to be fired with careful precision, especially considering the extreme expense paid per round. That being said, each round is capable of penetrating all but the most well armored tanks on capital worlds. This being the case due to their combination of conventional armor and dampening fields, although it is said that even these measures can be overcome with the right ammo. Ammo that has been made illegal on all core worlds. 
                        
                        The weapon is capable of firing from extreme range with a maximum effective range of two kilometers, leaving no chance for discovery before the operator has already evaced. However, just in case, the weapon has been outfitted with a bayonet capable of slicing through military grade armor for close quarter encounters. This final piece, while most considered unnecessary, is what ended up endearing the weapon within Yakuza circles.
                        
                        This special AM-0002 variant uses a lower caliber, but armor piercing round, and a large suppressor. Favoured by Yakuza hitmen.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Second Sun's sniper rifle, the ARV-D1, is a sniper rifle/railgun hybrid, that uses electromagnets to accelerate the projectile twice as fast. This has the upside of piercing through any armour with ease, but with the downside of a long warmup, due to the coils needing to be fully charged before firing.
                        
                        Although it's intended main role was an precise, long range anti-power armour weapon, the ARV-D1 was also used to combat armoured vehicles and mechanoids alike, with the former being easy if you know said armoured vehicle's weak spots.
                        
                        The only main issue is it's complexity and cost, mainly due to it's use of advanced components. As such, even amongst Second Sun troops, this weapon was considered a rarity on the battlefield. Though when it was used, it was highly effective\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Black Arrow, for when you want to annihilate your target at range.
                        
                        An AMR (Anti-Material Rifle) that is designed by Captain Lawrence of the Arian Liberation Army Sappers, specifically for his own special elite company, the Archers. With the first prototypes being built across various captured factories, Lawrence and his Archers would become an feared and decisive unit for the ALAS. Eventually, after the rifle's minor problems were fixed, a contract was given to Geron Industries to produce the new Black Arrow AMR for the ALA's sappers, and eventually, the galactic market.
                        
                        The gun itself, was praised for being light, but hard hitting, giving it a nickname called the "light fifty", due to it's use of 50. Cal ammunition, and similarities with a famous 21st century rifle, the M107 Barrett.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The most generic combat pistol ever made, the Bravo-9 has been serving in many urbworlds for thousands of years, with good reason. It's decent stopping power combined with excellent ergonomics make this sidearm a favourite amongst the common soldier.
                        
                        It originated all the way in the year 2258, with a (now defunct) Terran company called United Arms. Although the reason why this pistol was invented was lost to time, it's unparalleled success amongst several militaries catapulted the pistol to be the gold standard for military pistols.
                        
                        At the time, Plasteel was a relatively new material, and usually only used in spaceships. The Bravo-9, however, used it in it's slide. This caused the pistol to be a bit pricey, and hard to produce, but it balanced the pistol much better than a steel slide, reducing recoil.
                        
                        Overall, around 100 million Bravo-9's have been produced across 3000+ years, though seeing one on a rimworld isn't exactly common, as these were never officially sold to civillians.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The BRL-375 is the standard combat rifle of the Second Sun private military corporation. A bulky, but short rifle, the BRL-375 curiously uses a modified version of a caliber often used for hunting animals. This allows it to have improved accuracy somewhat, with the bonus of dealing a large amount of damage. Because of this, it has been often classified as a "Battle Carbine".
                        
                        It's main downside is that the gun loses it's accuracy at medium ranges, due to the barrel simply being too short for the gunpowder to ignite fully. This is why the front of the gun has a built-in, non-removable flash hider, to somewhat reduce the massive fireball this gun produces
                        
                        This SD variant features an integrally suppressed barrel, thermal scope and subsonic ammo. the ammo reduces the range even further, but the scope helps with any further accuracy problems.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The BU-5488 is a pump-action shotgun, made for Asgard III's military. Invented just mere years ago, the weapon is designed for their Tac-FLEX program, which is designed to overhaul the current ageing weapons of the military. The BU-5488 is the military's new shotgun, boasting 2 tubes for double the capacity, an ergonomic and imposing chassis, standardised camouflage, and a next-gen holosight for easier aiming. Unusually, shipments have gone missing containing weapons like these, which either end up in the hands of wealthy pirates who plundered them in the first place, or sold here, on this rimworld.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Ornate. Accurate. Deadly. All words to describe the C-HNTR, a high-end charge hunting rifle made by Akker Rose Industries. The rifle is most commonly used by various Thrumbo hunters that originate from various glitterworlds. For a weapon this expensive, it's no wonder why these are a common sight amongst royalty and faction leaders.
                        
                        It's unique and compact ball scope is able to be detached easily, acting like a GPS and tracker. When aiming, the scope displays wind speed, gravity and vital spots.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The C3-BRST is the result of another contract won out by Debna and Lephleon. This time for use by law enforcement officers stationed on Deros V. 
                        
                        The contract called for a sleek new weapon offering a three round burst, and a dead man bio-encryption. This causes the weapon to detonate when either the officer's vitals go out, or the weapon has been apart from the officer for more than one hour without being disabled by the officer. 
                        
                        Thankfully all weapons are encrypted to the precinct armorers as well, as many officers tend to forget to disable their weapon once during their early days in service. This only ever happens once, since the armorer is notified of the mistake by the 10 minute warning message sent to his post. He then with a sudden rush of adrenaline quickly disables the gun. Following this the officer in question is thoroughly abused verbally so that they never make the same mistake again. Those that do, no longer carry a badge.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The main, standard issue military rifle of the Noboka Imperium, the Carolina series of rifles are known for their elegance, and accuracy. 2 versions were developed and produced at the same time, the Mk1, a civilian version made for hunting, and a Mk2 military version, which is built sturdier and cheaper, to be easily mass produced.
                        
                        The Mk1 version is generally considered as being more accurate, but weaker and more fragile than the Mk2.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>The Cornucopia is the legendary sniper rifle of the "Rainbow Princess", who is also known as Fortuna Kisegari. Although this one isn't her actual rifle, it is a licensed copy made by a lot of corporations. The copy has comparable power to the original, but it could never beat it out.
                        
                        The rifle utilised various, specially made ultratech parts called "Fortuna Parts" to give it's "infinite range" and unrivalled stopping power. This does mean, however, that the rifle is extremely expensive, and that crafting one requires a lifetime of skill\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The CXY-102 anti-material autorifle was the product of a joint venture of Kruz Industries and Akker Rose Industries. With the power of Kruz industries' designs, and Akker Rose Industries' resources, the CXY-102 was born to be a mechanoid killer, for armoured marine units. The rifle's weight was not of concern when it was designed, as both Industries knew that only the strongest and well equipped would be able to wield the rifle.
                         
                        Thankfully, this one's the CXY-103, a later, and improved model. The weight was cut down by 5 kilograms, and many of the external parts were replaced by plasteel. That being said, the rifle still weighed 7.5 kilograms, which is just about usable. Just watch the recoil!\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Based off a 20th century design called the Uzi, the Czi is a compact charge machine pistol manufactured by Kirin arms. Designed for various crewmen of tanks, ships and mechs, the Czi's suppressive firepower seemingly beats out low-grade LMG's. This portable firepower makes missions behind enemy lines for spec-ops groups very dangerous, as if they were spotted, a hail of charged bullets would light them up.
                        
                        The firerate was so fast, however, that high recoil and short range plagued this weapon, limiting it's effectiveness on an actual battlefield. In addition, it's firerate made it burn through ammunition extremely quickly, making it hard to keep up the supply of ammunition for it. At least the gun won't jam very often.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Dara-67 has seen it all. War, famine, pestilence and death. And yet, it's design is still manufactured to this day, despite swapping manufacturers seemingly every year. Born from the ashes during the 4th corporate war of 2967, the Dara-67 became to be known to not have any license, meaning anyone can produce it. Sometimes you might find one that looks like it's been assembled in a garage with pot metal and hope, while you may find one made by the late Cycle and Co, before they made the H3A-VY, all the way to handcrafted, engraved pieces of art.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>Do you want to put a big hole in something? Well, Second sun has the Dawnshatter 10-Gauge! The Dawnshatter's main purpose is to pierce armour with great accuracy and at a low cost. It does this via special 10-Gauge APFS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilising) slugs, and a rifled barrel. The rifled barrel does mean that traditional buckshot cannot be used without damaging the barrel and rifling, however.
                        
                        The Dawnshatter is popular with backline troops due to their cheap cost and lack of easy access of the BRL-375, but it is also often used in a frontline role rarely, as it has about the same range as a BRL-375.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

Equipped with a small variable scope, integral suppressor and a long bullpup design, This rifle is a no-nonsense war tool of precision. However, it's main downside is that the rifle makes a significant hole in your pocket, due to the already mentioned features, tight tolerances and Plasteel body. That, and it's a little bit heavy for an assault rifle due to the integral suppressor being rather large.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Another weapon designed for the New Southern Falch Army, this one being won out by the Geron Conglomerate. The Army was looking for a new universal machine gun to replace the ones they were currently buying from the Grand Republic. This is where the Dorza GPMG took center stage.
                        
                        The weapon was simple and reliable with a cyclic rate that could be adjusted by a quick break down and swapping of a single part. This by itself sold the brass on how universally useful the Dorza could be for their military. Whether the weapon was mounted in vehicles, part of mobile battle fronts, or stationary defensive positions, it could easily be adapted to suit the needs of the situation. 
                        
                        It’s only downside was that of its weight due to Gerons choice of materials and design. At first the military wished for a lighter weapon but Geron won them over by explaining just how reliable the weapon was and given the weapons intended use in so many different situations, the importance of that reliability. 
                        
                        To this day, every case of weapon malfunction has been eventually attributed to user error or negligence.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The M326 “DustBunny” SAW was introduced during the war between Arcozia and Greater Keff due to the need of providing smaller squads greater firepower when breaching and clearing the cave systems in use by Arcozian fundamentals. 
                        
                        The Dustbunny earned its name eliminating the desert dwelling resistance fighters who held back during the initial clear, trying to surprise the primary team, only to meet a bloody end by the supporting team covering their rear. 
                        
                        The gun itself is a rugged weapon designed for combat in the dirty windswept region encompassed by the desert of Keff. In a place where sand got into everything it was designed to function in these harsh environments without error. An electrostatic barrier is maintained through a low emission battery pack stored in the buttstock of the weapon for easy swapping. This is what enables the weapon to carry on without worry of jam or malfunction even when swapping out magazines or belt feeding munitions. This countermeasure is however, compromised in humid environments; the weapon never being designed for that theatre of war.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <label>persona E-12</label>
                            <description>The E-12 was originally designed by one, Fredrik Leijstrom, a man woefully poor of shot but endowed with an enormous bank account. You see- he enjoyed hunting, but due to damaged nerves in his later years he could no longer rely on his hand responding in a reliable manner. To solve this issue he set about creating a weapon that could compensate for his disability. Thus the Eyal line was born, providing strength where his body lacked. (writers note, Eyal is a jewish name for strength) 
                        
                        In the end what most reliably solved the problem was switching from a conventional projectile to an energy based weapon. This, combined with a long burst fire mode, allowed the user to take aim, fire, and then maintain that fire as they adjusted aim in real time. 
                        
                        Sadly though, the weapon never caught on commercially as other hunters either felt it took away the skill from the hunt, or complained about the hideously mutilated corpses left by the vivisecting beams of the weapon. 
                        
                        Thus the E-12 languished in warehouses for years, until finding a new home with a group of cultists surprised by their luck looting the old dusty boxes. It was in their hands that the E-12 would become feared, as the red radiance spread forth heralding a new order. 
                        
                        The cult went out of their way securing this weapon from then on due to how universally useful its features were. The long burst mode made even the newest initiates a threat to be wary of, and then as their aim improved they could return to the standard fire mode. 
                        
                        That being said, even the veteran would find use with the long burst mode under the circumstances. It made short work of fights in tight spaces where you could dispose of grouped heretics quickly and was equally useful in cutting through reinforced doorways and the ilk.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The F4 charge rifle was the first ever charge rifle developed. Invented by General Major Ronan Swift of Calico IV's second army back in 2983, It was bulky, ran hot and was more of a proof of concept. Despite this, the weapon was very popular due to it's cheap cost in later versions. However, it is still inferior to more modern charge rifles.
                        
                        Even though it's technologically inferior, the costs made it a favourite amongst pirates long after it's first production run due to it's ability to pierce power armour.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>An officer's favourite, the GS-Hi-Cal Battle Pistol has endured the sands of time and has proven itself that by just fitting a bigger bullet in a pistol makes it more appealing to use. Using a cut down sniper rifle bullet, this iconic handgun features high damage at the cost of a hefty weight and price tag.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                        That being said, with the extent of their holdings, they employ their own personal military and outfit them with designs engineered in house. One such design is the GSGS-LP, an ultralight micro SMG, the GSGS-LP is standard issue for all Geron security guards in corporate facilities. 
                        
                        Since by and large Geron security’s mere presence is more than enough to maintain order the weapons were kept light with focus on suppressive fire meant to provide time for a kill team to arrive equipped for the situation.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>Cycle and Co's H3A-VY is a prime example on not how to copy a gun. based off the 7G Kilo, Cycle and Co's attempt to copy it took a wrong turn through development hell, causing the gun to take 6 years to get a first working prototype. Their plan was a big reveal at the bi-annual Alpha Centauri arms show, with a large booth dedicated to the rifle.
                        
                        The gun was advertised as being a cheap, but incredibly powerful battle rifle, with all attendee's being given a free rifle. Ultimately however, the publicity stunt failed, as glaring problems were discovered quickly, like how the unique caliber was too unstable, and that the rife weight far too much, 9 kilograms to be exact.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The HCR-5263 is one massive piece of equipment, originally designed as a coaxial machine gun for armored vehicles operating in the Pan-Fleudren theatre, it was adapted for infantry use much to the dismay of some poor bastard. 
                        
                        It can be fired from the hip to provide suppressive fire but is recommended to be fired utilizing the telescoping bipod attached. Otherwise, with its high cyclic rate, troops tend to do little more than burn through ammo. Ideally utilized as part of a two man team with the support member carrying a light firearm and all the additional ammo necessary to maintain fire.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Helios GL is a extremely simple breech-loading grenade launcher designed by Debna and Lephleon to win contracts across multiple systems, and so it did, winning a total of 15 contracts from militaries like the New Southern Falch Army. Even mega-corporations like Second Sun were interested in supplying the launcher to their trrops, although in limited numbers.
                        
                        It's fame comes from it's cheap cost, low weight and nice, modern ergonomics. It's only known downside is that it's a single shot launcher, meaning you'll spend as long reloading as firing it.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Historia Mk4 is the 4th version of a line of lightweight, low-caliber SMG's. Using a side-fed magazine arrangement, and lightweight parts, the Historia was originally built for Lady Historia of the Noboka Imperium. This original version, now referred to as the Mk1, was given to her palace's guards. Later, a Mk2 was designed for the army, and a few Mk3 prototypes for special flechette ammo. The most common version, however. is the Mk4, which was designed for civillians.
                        
                        The Mk1 is the rarest and most valuable version, with gold plating around the metal parts and an engraved stock.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Historia Mk4 is the 4th version of a line of lightweight, low-caliber SMG's. Using a side-fed magazine arrangement, and lightweight parts, the Historia was originally built for Lady Historia of the Noboka Imperium. This original version, now referred to as the Mk1, was given to her palace's guards. Later, a Mk2 was designed for the army, and a few Mk3 prototypes for special flechette ammo. The most common version, however. is the Mk4, which was designed for civillians.
                        
                        The Mk2 Was the Army's standard SMG for many centuries, though to this day, very few get offworld and end up on the open market. It's built to last, however.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                        The Mk3 is an experimental version, set for semi-auto only and uses a special bullet that splits into 3, increasing hit probability.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Designed as a cheap alternative to the Black Arrow, Cycle and Co's HSR-50 failed to be nearly as good as the Black Arrow. The mechanism was just simply not strong enough to last a long time. Because of this blunder, Cycle and Co was forced to recall the rifles, which were already in circulation.
                        
                        Thankfully, after some third party fixes and modifications, the rifle turned out to be a solid and hard hitting rifle, popular with various militia and pirates, though accuracy problems still remained.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Made by Ho-Kago Arms, the HW5A-Y is a mechanically advanced gas-operated assault rifle with a complex hyperburst firing system, that fires 2 shots at a very high firerate. This means that the gun's recoil would feel like firing a singe shot. Overall, the HW5A-Y was just simply too expensive to be mass deployed by armies, though certain elite forces were able to afford them, due to their low numbers.
                        
                        This HW5A-U variant Turns up the hyperburst to 3 shots, while turning the weapon into a compact SMG.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>A symbol of justice, the Isbrytare-582 has been serving many Urbworld police forces with the PC-T21 carbine. Featuring navy blue grips, easy to use sights and a basic but effective design, this gun is ideal for bringing justice to the rim, one bullet at a time.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Originally a marksman rifle, the KwSR-IX was converted to full-auto and turned into a high-caliber battle rifle. Made by United Arms originally, the first iterations, the KwSR-I to KwSR-IV saw good success and a large amount of sales. Kirin Arms would take over production, making the KwSR-V and KwSR-VI. The KwSR-VII and KwSR-VIII versions we're lighter and smaller than the others, and eventually Kirin arms created the KwSR-IX.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Krin resistance had a problem- thick ass armor plates- and their current LMG’s just weren’t cutting it. Fortuitously the Grand Republic happened to “lose” a shipment of KYR-75 high caliber LMGs which ended up in the hands of Krin resistance fighters. It was thanks to this sudden influx of weapons able to penetrate Kyrosvian armor that the rebellion was able to hold out as long as it did, though ultimately it would be crushed under Kyros’ iron fist.
                        
                        This delay was enough however for the Grand Republic to shore up its southern defenses securing another decade of freedom.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Cycle and Co's Liberator Carbine was arguably their best-selling product. A cheap, fully automatic carbine, the Liberator's role was to be a firearm that can be dropped into cities to be used by rebels and freedom fighters alike. Overall, the weapon was praised for it's lightweightness, though build quality was generally considered pretty poor.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>Another weapon designed by Aker Rose Industries, this one had not yet left RnD when a prototype was stolen by a false flag operation run by the Carak CorpNation. They would rename it the Longfield Prototype and began equipping some of their elite kill teams with the weapon. 
                        
                        The weapon could fire twin APFSDS rounds at extreme range but would consume the entirety of its charge pack with each fire. This meant that they were best used either in gun emplacements or as part of a two man team with one support member carrying additional charge packs. The upside to the charge packs is that they could be easily recharged at the appropriate charging station once returned from the field. 
                        
                        The charge packs are the only serious bottleneck when firing the weapon, otherwise it is able to cycle through ammunition much like a battle rifle. It is said that Aker Rose had been working on a more efficient power source able to power multiple firings, however after the theft of the Longfield they have doubled down on security and no further information has been learned on the project.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>Inspired by an iconic 20th century gangster SMG, the Tommy Mk2 is a "Spray and Pray" SMG, with a big caliber. Designed to be hip-fired, the SMG can wreak havoc on a group of enemies, thanks to it's large, iconic drum magazine, and heavy weight. Although an red dot sight was standard, most people would just simply not use them.
                           
                           This military model uses a stick magazine and a slow firerate for precision firing.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

A few hundred years later, and a gunsmith by the name of Hector Louisiana discovers the original plans. This prompted him to make a compact, charge submachinegun out of said blueprint.
                        
                        This new, M55-K version was far more popular than the original M55, as it's charge technology and compactness was far more appealing to various militaries. HL-Armoury would be created to solely produce this SMG, though eventually the branched out into making the MAZ-SA charge shotgun.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>After the Large amount of success and money the M55-K brought in, HL-Armoury would go on to remaster another, much older blueprint, a 21st century M1014. All but the receiver and it's internals was changed, and a device to charge the shells was positioned at the end of the receiver. Overall, the weapon received great praise for it's effectiveness at close range, though accuracy was a concern, due to the way the charge device was installed.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>The most generic combat pistol ever made, the Bravo-9 has been serving in many urbworlds for thousands of years, with good reason. It's decent stopping power combined with excellent ergonomics make this sidearm a favourite amongst the common soldier.
                        
                        It originated all the way in the year 2258, with a (now defunct) Terran company called United Arms. Although the reason why this pistol was invented was lost to time, it's unparalleled success amongst several militaries catapulted the pistol to be the gold standard for military pistols.
                        
                        At the time, Plasteel was a relatively new material, and usually only used in spaceships. The Bravo-9, however, used it in it's slide. This caused the pistol to be a bit pricey, and hard to produce, but it balanced the pistol much better than a steel slide, reducing recoil.
                        
                        Overall, around 100 million Bravo-9's have been produced across 3000+ years, though seeing one on a rimworld isn't exactly common, as these were never officially sold to civillians.
                        
                        This special Mk9 version sas issued to special forces, and features multiple high-end features such as a mounted red dot sight, improved grip, manual slide lock, a light/laser system and a high-end suppressor. The manual slide lock requries the gun to be cycled each time after firing, however.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Second Sun's NE-49 is a quick-firing semi-automatic pistol equipped with all sorts of standard issue upgrades, such as a light slide and hair trigger to increase the firerate, making the pistol's recoil very snappy. This was solved quickly, however, with a compenstor being built into the barrel and slide. A flared magwell assists with reloading, and a large slide release make the gun easy to manipulate. Overall, the gun is designed to be quick to bring out and fire, before the enemy reacts. Second Sun soldiers are often given the NE-49 as a back-up pistol when they are hired, as part of their standard loadout.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>The OH-2 was designed to address two specific situations: the first being need to apply excessive force to a situation and secondly going longer without need for reloading. The weapon fires in turn from each barrel, though by changing firing modes this becomes unnoticeable. 
                        
                        The most common malfunctions, as you can imagine, have to do with cycling the weapon. Sometimes there is a failure to cycle or in worst cases a bullet is sheared off and must be forced out of the barrel. The only other drawback is the overall weight of the weapon once loaded and ready to fire. 
                        
                        The weapon by and large performs admirably and has seen great success throughout the seven planets you can most widely find it in use. It does carry a significant price tag especially when you take into account the amount of ammo that can be spent during operations.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Capital world officers along the Dedderid system have long been known for extravagance, often demanding an ungodly amount of gold accents in their officers quarters and conference chambers. The P-C2S1 became “the” weapon of choice,after being adopted by naval officer Vladiskov the 7th famous for his complete devastation of the Gand Republic fleet in the battle of Nyx III. The battle which Kyros would capitalize on securing a number of victories against the Grand Republic in the region now that that looming threat had been dealt with. 
                        
                        Vladiskov would execute Admiral Gervinsk live using the P-C2S1 much to the surprise and delight of his country's people. A scaled down Particle Projector Cannon originally used in mechs, the weapon left only the bottom half of Admiral Gervinsk. It would see little use in combat since the average naval officer sat comfortably at the bridge, however it became a favorite for public executions after that day.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Geron Conglomerates works hard to spread out its assets to make it difficult for outsiders to realize the full scale of their operation. As part of this, they enjoy accompanying new colonists setting up on rimworlds and selling them armaments specially designed for just such ventures. 
                        
                        One such weapon, the Pathfinder-2, is a charge rifle perfectly suited for scout missions and expeditions to unexplored lands. Geron is well known for making weapons that work without the operator ever having to worry about mechanical failures, so long as they follow proper maintenance guidelines. This requires bringing to a licensed Geron facility, but all excellence comes at a cost.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>After a recent string of outcrys, the Democratic Republic of Iterrum found itself looking for a new weapon to outfit its police force capable of effectively handling crime in the newly acquired northern reaches of the nation.
                        
                        Having only recently been freed of their previous leadership the citizens were not cooperating as much as the Republic had hoped. Originally precision artillery strikes were used to deal with criminals in the area, however the local populace were in riot about all the collateral damages. Thus after much grumbling the brass finally agreed to contract a new police force and settled on the PC-T21 for the weapon of choice to outfit them with.
                        
                        The PC-T21 carbine provided the police force significant firepower without taking away from their mobility and effectiveness in urban environments. Now it was true that collateral damage had seen a steep drop after the deployment of this new “Freedom Force”, sent to protect the freedoms of upstanding citizens; it was later debated whether flashbang grenades were appropriate as often they were being applied. The biggest concern was their application in response to noise violation complaints.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Penta-64 charge SMG seems to have less been manufactured than conjured by magic. So great was its overwhelming presence in the market at time of release that to this day the phenomenon is still being studied by marketing execs everywhere. 
                        
                        The weapon appears by all accounts an otherwise unremarkable charge SMG manufactured by Geron Industries- a company while prolific across seemingly every system, never showed strong marketing presence, instead relying on their brand’s tried and true decision to let the product speak for itself. 
                        
                        Honestly it’s only claim above other charge SMGs is its above average capacity. Experts still wonder if this really was what warranted the Penta-64s complete dominance of the market.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The PF-T1 by Geron Industries is a conventional alternative to the Pathfinder-2 for those on a budget or afraid of the negative press in recent days claiming that charge weapons get their charge from draining the soul of the user. Claims that are completely baseless; however as always Geron Industries is happy to provide weapons to any and all individuals no matter their level of religious fanaticism. We understand that many pilgrims seek out rimworlds to escape persecution of core citizens who believe in science and facts, so that they can live out their lives in the poignant ignorance the uncivilized far reaches of space provide.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>Many would laugh at you for using this in combat, but as a last ditch weapon, the Puffin CC-22 is a cheap, very low caliber pistol. It's quick aim time, and low recoil make it perfect for quick target shooting. However, it's small caliber lacks any stopping power, or even damage for that matter.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Sometimes a regular gun just won’t cut it and you need a charge rifle, and sometimes a charge rifle just won’t cut it- that's when the PZ7-62 rocket launcher steps in to save the day. It features a wide array of ammunition types to solve all of your problems. Whether it's a need for shaped charges capable of taking down heavy armor, or just creating an explosion covering the nearby savages in white phosphorus - the PZ7-62 has got you covered!\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The RD-5492 is a bullpup assault rifle, made for Asgard III's military. Invented just mere years ago, the weapon is designed for their Tac-FLEX program, which is designed to overhaul the current ageing weapons of the military. The RD-5492 is the military's new assault rifle, boasting a bullpup design to increase barrel length while maintaining compactness, a plasteel chassis, standardised camouflage, and a next-gen holosight for easier aiming. Unusually, shipments have gone missing containing weapons like these, which either end up in the hands of wealthy pirates who plundered them in the first place, or sold here, on this rimworld.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>There are many who travel to the rim seeking to get away from the hustle and bustle of core life. Who seek to forego the convenience of modern society and live the much simpler life of a bygone era. For those who enjoy such rustic life we present the Great Era line of replica weapons.
                        
                        Among them is the Rotationsgewer-X99, a simple callback to miniguns of the era, it features a sealed battery pack providing all the convenience you’ve come to expect without taking away from the experience as it balances the weight perfectly against the bulky barrel system. Belt fed and beautifully realized you’ll come to find that you don’t know how you got by without it. 
                        
                        As part of the Great Era line it comes with a limited edition certificate of authenticity, personally signed by Leon of Tempos V himself.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Rosetta Pattern charge rifle is of clean solid white plasteel construction in homage to the purity of the Cardinal Feznibbet the 2nd and as a reminder to those who wield it of the holy task they have been given. For the Cardinal was God’s chosen mouthpiece and it was he who ordained that the heathen world of Palacia V would become the Cardinals new seat of power. 
                        
                        The world had been known as the most luxurious vacation world in the entire Tilloxian System where such debauchery and hedonism took place that it had set a fire in the Lord’s heart. A fire that would not be quenched until the golden idols had been cast down and a new great white temple raised on the ashes.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>When corp-nation Carak Conglomerates needs to put down resistance in close quarter urban combat, they look no further than the Houndtooth SASG. A semi automatic shotgun firing depleted uranium scattershot, the Houndtooth launches the rounds at an incredible 1500 m/s. Deadly at short range, the Houndtooth quickly earned its name with its signature shredding pattern left on the unfortunate victims of its bite. 
                        
                        Many smaller nations have petitioned the regulatory branches of their planet’s government to ban the weapon as a human right’s violation to no avail; those governments knowing better than to find themselves the next victims of the Hounds bite.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                        This M66 has been heavily modified to be an air-cooled mounted aircraft gun, with a very high firerate. A lot of weight has been saved by making the gun air-cooled, though this does mean it does overheat much easier.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>The SM-5498 is a PDW, made for Asgard III's military. Invented just mere years ago, the weapon is designed for their Tac-FLEX program, which is designed to overhaul the current ageing weapons of the military. The SM-5498 is the military's new PDW, replacing their SMG's and machine pistols. Boasting a plasteel chassis, standardised camouflage, and a next-gen holosight for easier aiming. Unusually, shipments have gone missing containing weapons like these, which either end up in the hands of wealthy pirates who plundered them in the first place, or sold here, on this rimworld.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Designed by Gerwulf Grunnmann, the Grunnmann STB-631 DMR is a nice, lightweight marksman rifle. While it lacks in stopping power, it's ideal for caravans and assaults thanks to it's low weight.
                        
                        Oddly enough, Aero Dynamics was chosen to produce the rifle, as although they made the rifle even lighter, they ct corners and made the gun rather fragile in the process.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

It's massive, long drum holds a massive amount of ammo for said sustained fire. In addition, it's thick barrel and specialised cooling handguard aid with cooling down the weapon's barrel. This however, makes the firearm very hard to wield.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>Designed as part of a military contract for the elite commando units of Kyros’, the TK-65 high caliber battle rifle provided troopers with undeniable firepower. Most commonly paired with depleted uranium rounds, those that fought against the weapon had their lives cut short as neither the cover they cowered behind nor the armor on their bodies could stand between them and certain death. 
                        
                        After the overwhelming success of the weapon, the Kyrosvian army would negotiate an exclusive contract with Grand Maul Designs. It’s due to this marriage of cold steel and ceaseless conquest that Grand Maul’s weapons would become synonymous with the crushing weight of the Kyrosvian State.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Inspired by an iconic 20th century gangster SMG, the Tommy Mk2 is a "Spray and Pray" SMG, with a big caliber. Designed to be hip-fired, the SMG can wreak havoc on a group of enemies, thanks to it's large, iconic drum magazine, and heavy weight. Although an red dot sight was standard, most people would just simply not use them.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>The Type 3354 remains the first and only assault rifle designed by androids, marketed by androids, and manufactured by androids. An assault rifle passing such strict QA testing that one would think Geron Industries made it- and yet it largely sat unsold in warehouses collecting dust.

                        In one word “robots”, because while design and manufacture by ultra intelligent metal beings sounds positive, when it came to marketing it left much to be desired. The slogan, “The best weapon to eradicate meatbags you’ll ever own”, just did not resonate with the target audience.
                        
                        This one is a short-barreled carbine version, with a lightweight stock and shortened barrel, which decreases range but improves it's CQB abilities and weight\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity.

                            <description>Raptor’s most expensive charge rifle on the market- the UKN-OW is a weapon for those with style that goes on for over a mile.
                        
                        Do you love making the competition’s head burst from jealousy but can’t stand the ear ringing noise of other charge rifles? Then look no further than the UKN-OW! 
                        
                        Based on top secret alien technology recently leaked from classified government facilities! The UKN-OW is out of this world!  
                        
                        Just read any of our firewall 5 reviews!
                        
                        I had recently taken charge of the 10KlawKrew and knew that my old 357-Secant was great but just didn’t carry the class befitting a leader. That's when I spent all of our former leader’s funeral expenses to purchase the UKN-0W and boy was it worth it! Now not only can I take the head off a rival gang member from the safety of my own turf, but I can do it while looking like a complete badass! Thanks UKN-0W!\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person.

                            <description>There are many who travel to the rim seeking to get away from the hustle and bustle of core life. Who seek to forego the convenience of modern society and live the much simpler life of a bygone era. For those who enjoy such rustic life we present the Great Era line of replica weapons.
                        
                        Among them is the Verstaker-G132, featuring the rugged design brought to you by the front line, the Verstaker-G132 is a must have for the great outdoorsman! The gun is capable of handling anything that nature throws your way! You’ll find that whether you’re taking shots at the native savages from a distance or breaking their collar bones in melee, the Verstaker by Tennebris Systems can not only take a beating but dish it out in equal measure!
                        
                        As part of the Great Era line it comes with a limited edition certificate of authenticity, personally signed by Leon of Tempos V himself.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Another creation of Debna and Lephleon, This time for Asgard III, the XP-AMR is an massive anti-material sniper rifle designed to fire large-caliber, propriety airburst rounds. This put it in a unique, long range support role where it was used against installations and enemies alike that were hiding in cover.
                        
                        Due to the complexity of said airburst rounds, everyone on this rimworld prefers to use cheaper, but still effective high-explosive rounds.
                        
                        Though outdated for Asgard III's military in terms of design, the weapon still serves as their anti-material rifle.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>

                            <description>Along the periphery of core systems where you’ll still find much of the world covered by civilization, it's quite commonplace for people to at least wear low grade integrated mesh body armors as part of their work attire. Due to this fact those operating in the business of lifting poorly secured property have found the need for greater firepower capable of piercing these low end body armors. 
                        
                        This is where the YY8-SD shines, featuring an extended mag and firing specialized armor piercing rounds, this SMG provides groups with an easy to use weapon that can make even the newest recruits an effective force. Not only this but the weapon features an adjustable but stock, silencer and optical scope allowing for easy ambushes.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>
